  J.A.S.O.N. loves playing chess, and hopes everyone enjoys playing it as well. 
  This chess game supports two players and follows the normal rules of chess. 
  Users will be prompted to make a move again if their move was invalid.
  We have implemented user friendly functionality that helps with gameplay, 
  by suggesting possible legal moves if what the user tried was illegal. 
  This game is played via the terminal and users can enter extra command line
  arguments to customize the color of the board.
