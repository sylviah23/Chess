To run our demo, first download our project files. 
We use ANSITerminal, so please use opam to install that:
$ opam update
$ opam upgrade
$ opam install ansiterminal

cd to the project directory in terminal. 
Then run dune exec bin/main.exe. 
Then, our demo will start running.
You can start moving the chess pieces now :)
